# Azure Onboarding

> :star: **Tip:** Our team i.e. Azure Portal team has  put together next section of documentation to help partners identify the right people for onboarding Azure. If you identify that the list is out-of-date then please help other partners by [contributing](../../Contributing.md) to the documentation.

Welcome to the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/) ! We're excited to have you to join the family and become a partner. 

The Azure onboarding process is streamlined to help partners deliver high-quality experiences that meet Microsoft Common Engineering Criteria (CEC) and compliance requirements, to optimize developer resources and to reduce re-working due to anti-patterns and inconsistencies. Therefore, we strongly recommend starting the onboarding process prior to designing UI or management APIs.

**Prerequisites to Azure Onboarding**

To ensure that business goals of your service are aligned with the Azure's business strategy please reach out  to [Brian Hillger’s team, Stacey Ellingson](mailto:ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20Business%20model%20review)) from Business Stratergy team for business model review.

The next section of the document assumes that you have received an approval on your business model and you are ready to onboard your service to Azure. 

**Post Approval from Business Model Review**

The following section of the document lists the contact information for all components that services need to onboard in order for onboarding Azure services. For any information about onboarding these components, please reach out to the contacts listed in each section.

## **Azure Compliance**

Compliance criteria and practices are defined in [Quality Essentials](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/QualityEssentials/SitePages/GettingStarted.aspx) throughout our development cycle. These practices ensure services meet the Trusted Cloud commitments outlined in the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/trust-center/) for our customers. There are mandatory procedures as Preview and GA requirement, and to be revisited for every release cycle. QE provides the UI access to manage the release policies and procedures for each compliance. The tool can be installed from [QE](http://qe).

QE tracks the following:
    - Accessibility
    - Global readiness
    - Global trade compliance
    - License terms
    - Open source software
    - Privacy
    - Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
    - Software integrity

Some of the procedures such as Accessibility, GB Certificate, Privacy, and Security are also measured in the
[Service Health Review Scorecard](https://aka.ms/shr) and exit criteria for management review and tracking.
